# Basic Premake setup

This is very basic premake setup that I use for C++.

# Build instructions

## Windows

1. Run the [setup.bat](./scripts/setup.bat) file found in the `scripts` folder. This will download the required prerequisites for the project if they are not present yet.
2. After that run the [Win-GenProject-vs2019.bat](./scripts/Win-GenProject-vs2019.bat) script file to generate a visual studio 2019 project.

## Mac and linux

This setup currently does not support mac and linux.
